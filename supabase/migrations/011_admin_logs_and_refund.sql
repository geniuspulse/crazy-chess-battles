-- Migration 011: Fix missing admin_logs table and refund_withdrawal RPC
-- These are referenced throughout the app (admin panel, withdrawal approve/reject)
-- but were never created. refund_withdrawal in particular is a live financial bug:
-- if a mobile-money payout fails after a withdrawal was debited, the app tries to
-- call refund_withdrawal to give the money back — but the function doesn't exist,
-- so the refund silently fails while the admin is told "Wallet has been refunded."

-- ============================================================
-- 1. admin_logs table — audit trail for admin panel actions
-- ============================================================
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.admin_logs (
  id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  admin_id    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.profiles(id),
  action      TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_type TEXT,
  target_id   TEXT,
  details     JSONB,
  created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

ALTER TABLE public.admin_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Admins read admin logs" ON public.admin_logs FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true)
);
CREATE POLICY "Admins insert admin logs" ON public.admin_logs FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_admin_logs_created_at ON public.admin_logs(created_at DESC);

-- ============================================================
-- 2. refund_withdrawal RPC — atomically refund a withdrawal to the
--    user's wallet and mark it rejected. Used when an admin rejects
--    a pending withdrawal, or when a mobile-money payout fails after
--    the wallet was already debited.
-- ============================================================
