/**
 * Resolves a game whose active player's clock has hit zero. Shared by:
 * - /api/game/move (self-check when a player tries to move after their own clock died)
 * - /api/game/timeout-check (client-callable check, polled by the opponent's tab)
 * - /api/game/timeout (cron sweep over all active games)
 *
 * Two outcomes:
 * - ABORT — nobody made a single move (move_count === 0). This is the
 *   "opponent never showed up" case: no winner, no rating change, no
 *   berries. Tournament and battle games are never aborted this way —
 *   they always resolve decisively since brackets/stakes need a result.
 * - TIMEOUT — a normal decisive loss for whoever's clock ran out. This is
 *   the "opponent disconnected mid-game" case: counts as a real result
 *   (rating change if rated, berries to the winner, battle/tournament
 *   settlement as usual).
